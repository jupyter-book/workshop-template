# Workshop Template

This repository provides a template for creating JB2 books using [MystMD](https://mystmd.org/). It is intended to be a general tool to support new users of Jupyter Book 2 and MystMD, in particular for use in workshop settings where participants may not have time or ability to install the required software on a personal computer.

_The Workshop Template was created for JupyterCon 2025. Slides are in the Turing Way Github Organization: [slides](https://the-turing-way.github.io/Build-a-Jupyter-Book-with-The-Turing-Way/#/4) and [repository](https://github.com/the-turing-way/Build-a-Jupyter-Book-with-The-Turing-Way)._

## Features

- Configured as a GitHub template repository, allowing duplication with only a few clicks.
- Pre-configured structure for MystMD book projects using two MyST Templates: `book-theme` for websites and `plain_typst_book` for PDF output. 
- Example content, configuration files and GitHub Actions workflow.
- Exercises for users to learn to easily edit and create content.
- Website and PDF are built and deployed using two separate GitHub Actions workflows.
- Installation and editing on a personal computer not required (due to GH Actions workflows).

## Getting Started

If you are using this Template to learn to use Jupyter Book 2 and/or MystMD, visit the GitHub Pages site [jupyter-book.github.io/workshop-template/](https://jupyter-book.github.io/workshop-template/) and follow the instructions.

If you have used this GitHub template repository to create a new book project, delete and/or modify the contents of this README and start editing your book!
