# MyST Document Creation ðŸŒ¶

This page introduces a few key concepts that will help understand how Jupyter Book 2 creates documents from source files written using MyST Markdown. We are particularly interested in understanding how _themes_ and _templates_ are used to create a website and PDF, respectively. 

Only a very brief overview is provided here; for additional technical explanation, refer to the [stack overview section of the MyST Guide](https://mystmd.org/guide/overview), as well as the [SciPy Paper](https://proceedings.scipy.org/articles/hwcj9957).

```{tip}
The term "MyST" is used here, rather than "Jupyter Book", because MyST is the underlying technology that Jupyter Book 2 uses to create documents. [As described elsewhere](https://proceedings.scipy.org/articles/hwcj9957#jupyter-book-2-a-distribution-of-myst-components):

> Jupyter Book 2 is a lightweight distribution and configuration layer on top of these and other components of the MyST ecosystem. It is meant to provide an opinionated experience of MySTâ€“for example, by turning on certain features by default...

```

## Key MyST Components

As you already know, Jupyter Book 2 is able to convert MyST Markdown written `*.md` and `*.ipynb` source files into websites: online books. However, there are many other formats that MyST can convert to, including PDF, LaTeX, Word, JATS XML, and more. The process is illustrated in the following figure:

Documents made in MyST Markdown can be converted to many different formats. These can be saved as JSON, or rendered to a website (like this one!) or any number of formats including [PDF & LaTeX](https://mystmd.org/guide/creating-pdf-documents), [Word](https://mystmd.org/guide/creating-word-documents), [React](https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-myst-documents), or [JATS](https://mystmd.org/guide/creating-jats-xml). Picture taken from the MYST documentation [^MYST].

In the demonstration below below, each tab illustrates the various output formats for a given MyST Markdown input:

:::{myst}
# This is a heading
This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text.
- This is a list item
- Another list item
```{warning} raw HTML
You can also include raw HTML in your Markdown files, but this will not be rendered in the PDF output.
```

## MyST Build Process

The "build" process, the process of converting MyST Markdown into a given output format, is more complex than the figure above suggests. In fact, it has [5 key steps](https://mystmd.org/guide/overview#overview-build-process): writing, parsing, resolving, rendering and exporting. Of this process, illustrated below, only the final step is of interest to us here, as it is where the rendered components of a document are combined with a _theme_ (for websites) or a _template_ (for PDF's) to create the final output document.

## Themes and Templates

For our purposes, a _theme_ or _template_ defines the final appearance of our document. Though a concise explanation is provided [here](https://mystmd.org/guide/overview#overview-themes), for this workshop it is sufficient to know that there are a number of different themes and templates available in the MyST ecosystem, and that it is possible to customize them to a high degree. An overview is provided at the [`myst-templates` GitHub organization](https://github.com/myst-templates).

Note in particular that there are currently only two themes in this organization: `book-theme` and `article-theme`. These are the [two themese bundled with MyST](https://mystmd.org/guide/website-templates#default-web-themes) and correspond to the two types of _websites_ that can be created. The code snippet below is from the `myst.yml` file of this book, which indicates the `book-theme` is used:

:::{literalinclude} ../../myst.yml
:start-at: site:
:end-at: hide_authors: true
:lineno-match:
:caption: Example of the `book-theme` specified in the `myst.yml` file.
:label: include_book_theme
:::

There is a relatively large number of templates listed in the [`myst-templates` GitHub organization](https://github.com/myst-templates), the vast majority of which create LaTeX documents (i.e., `*.tex` files). In fact, many of these templates are for articles formatted for publishing with specific journals and are used in combination with websites created using the `article-theme` to generate a PDF. The code snippet below is from the `myst.yml` file of this book, which indicates the `book-theme` is used:

:::{literalinclude} ../../myst.yml
:start-at: exports:
:end-at: id: output-pdf
:lineno-match:
:caption: Example of the `book-theme` specified in the `myst.yml` file.
:label: include_lapreprint

## Summary

That's enough detail about the MyST ecosystem for now. The main takeaways from this page are to recognize:
- themese and templates are used to customize the creation of final documents for a given source
- this book is initially set up with the `book-theme` for website generation and the `lapreprint-typst` template for PDF generation

Up to this point in the workshop you have been modifying the source code and using the `book-theme` to view changes on the rendered website; however, you have not yet generated a PDF. After a quick introduction to LaTeX and Typst on the following page, we will do just that in the next round of exercises!
